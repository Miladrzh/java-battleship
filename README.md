# BattleShip game implemented in Java
###### Tags: Java, Socket Programming, Swing
###### Clean Code Status: Refactor needed in order to remove some couplings

It is my final project in Advanced Programming course.


We implemented multiplayer [Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship) game with chat functionality.
It is good example if you wanted to learn socket programming, or UI programming with java.


### How to run project:
You can run project by running Main.java at the root of project.
In order to play game and chat, one must play the role of server and the other player can connect to him by using his ip.


Don't hesitate to ask question if you have problems with understanding or running code.
